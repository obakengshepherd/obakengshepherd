# Hi, I'm Tsaagane Obakeng Shepherd

I'm a final-year IT student with a strong focus on ##Backend Engineering and Full-Stack Development##. My work is centered around building secure, scalable, and cloud-native applications that reflect modern industry practices.

Iâ€™m currently developing a Super Capstone Project that brings together my skills across:

C# (ASP.NET Core MVC & Web API): Enterprise-grade backend services with authentication, EF Core, and payment integration.

JavaScript / TypeScript (Node.js): Real-time collaboration features with GraphQL, WebSockets, and async processing.

Microsoft Azure: Cloud-native deployment, CI/CD pipelines, serverless functions, and database services.

This project demonstrates end-to-end expertise in secure architectures, cloud solutions, and modern backend frameworks, designed to mirror real-world, production-grade applications.

Iâ€™m actively documenting the process, not just to showcase working software but also to highlight my journey of consistent growth, problem-solving, and delivery.

Feel free to explore my repositories, follow the projectâ€™s progress, or reach out for collaboration, networking, or career opportunities.

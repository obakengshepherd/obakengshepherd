## Hi, I'm Tsaagane Obakeng Shepherd

I'm a final year IT student with a strong focus on Full-Stack Development and Backend Engineering. To demonstrate both depth and breadth across different ecosystems, Iâ€™m currently working on three Capstone Projects â€” one in each of my core programming languages:

  Python: Full-Stack Django Application with REST API and AI integration.
  C#: Enterprise-Grade ASP.NET Core MVC + Web API with authentication, payment, and cloud deployment.
  JavaScript: Full MERN/Node.js + TypeScript Real-Time Collaboration Platform with GraphQL and WebSockets.

These projects are designed to replicate real-world, production-grade applications, showcasing skills in modern frameworks, secure architectures, and scalable design. They represent the culmination of my learning journey and serve as proof of concepts for recruiters and collaborators alike.

Iâ€™m actively documenting and building not just applications but also a consistent track record of growth and delivery.

Feel free to explore my repositories, follow the progress of these capstones, or reach out for collaboration, networking, or career opportunities.

## Hi, I'm Tsaagane Obakeng Shepherd

I'm a third-year IT student and I've been enjoying Full-Stack OpenTelemetry Development, with a focus on building scalable, observable systems. My projects include real-time telemetry tools and technologies, to ensure performance and reliability.

As an aspiring Senior Developer, Iâ€™m actively developing my portfolio through practical projects, internships, and open-source contributions, with a goal to deliver impactful solutions by my graduation in 2027. Explore my repositories to see my work in observability-driven applications, and feel free to connect for collaboration or job opportunities in these exciting domains!
